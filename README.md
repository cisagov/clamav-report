This is a tool that will collect ClamAV data using an
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) inventory and create a CSV file
that is able to be ingested by legacy compliance tools.

It assumes that ClamAV has been installed using the
[Ansible ClamAV role](https://github.com/cisagov/ansible-role-clamav).

## Usage ##

```console
$ clamav-report tests/files/inventory.txt clamav-201909.csv
